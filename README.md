# Abstract
Despite advances in camera systems and video recording technologies, many surveillance systems suffer from low-quality footage, storage compression and general loss in fidelity. We theorize that through the application of machine learning for image quality improvement, detection of objects and persons of interest in surveillance data could be substantially improved. We collected various publicly available datasets, including VisDrone as well as publicly available surveillance videos, utilizing Real-ESRGAN for image enhancement and Inception ResNet v2 for object detection. We believe this conceptual framework has the potential to benefit and improve upon home security, search and rescue teams and law enforcement, among others.
